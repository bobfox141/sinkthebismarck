# sinkthebismarck
a rewrite in ruby of the old text game. from Ken Tracton's 24 ready to run games in basic. I think these were originally in Pet Basic. I wasn't too worried. If I get a basic interpreter, then I might fix the spagetti in basic.
# Current stage: two. 
# Stage one: 
retype the game and correct the numbering and typos in basic
# Stage two:
input all the messages into a class so they are printable and don't clutter up the original game logic
# Stage three: 
game logic. Reinterpret and fix the game logic. Things like three different end game prompts, that kind of thing. 
# Stage four: 
write tests for the game logic. 
# Stage five: 
get it running, and then play it, fixing playability. 
# Stage six: 
make it better.
