REM SINK THE BISMARK 
REM -------->
This is an exciting chase game with many messages from the 
computer to the captain. 

Both vessels can fire at each other. Your mission is to sink the 
enemy before the enemy sinks you. As you get closer, the damage 
done by the high explosive shells becomes more pronounced. 

Caution: the number of shells available for either ship is limited. 
The number of shells is picked at random by the computer, yet there 
is always a minimum of 20 shells initially available to each ship. 

INSTRUCTIONS ARE: â€” 
THIS IS THE GAME OF SINK THE BISMARK 
BOTH YOUR VESSEL AND THAT 
OF THE ENEMY HAVE HIGH 
EXPLOSIVE SHELLS. 
YOUR MISSION IS TO SINK THE ENEMY 
VESSEL BEFORE IT CAN SINK 
YOUR VESSEL. 

THE NUMBER OF SHELLS AVAILABLE 
FOR BOTH YOU AND THE ENEMY ARE 
RANDOM-, BUT BOTH VESSELS HAVE A 
MINIMUM OF 20 SHELLS EACH. 
SHELLS ARE LESS EFFECTIVE AT LARGER 
DISTANCES. 

THE PRESENT DISTANCE IS NOW 1500 METERS 
WHAT IS YOUR COMMAND-, MOVE OR SHOOT 
ENTER M OR S [M] 
SORRY-, COMMANDER-, YOU HAVE NO MORE 
SHELLS-. YOU BETTER RETREAT TO PORT-,
